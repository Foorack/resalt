# ⚠️ RAPID DEVELOPMENT
## THIS PROJECT IS UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT, AND NOT YET STABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE.

# HIBIKE

Hibike is an open-source self-hosted web-based SaltStack administration management panel.

> *Hibike (Japanese: 響け [ひびけ]) means "to resound; to be heard far and wide". Cloud Orchestration is a common term in the container industry, and it is the hope with this tool that you will get a better insight and understanding of Salt. Like a dirigent conducting an orchestra, enjoy and build the sound of your infrastructure!*

By using Hibike, you can easily manage your SaltStack infrastructure.

## 🔧 Set-up

Easiest is to use the Docker container image [UNDER CONSTRUCTION].

## 💖 Contributing

Setup development system:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Both the frontend (Svelte) and backend (Rust) will reload automatically.
