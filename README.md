# ⚠️ RAPID DEVELOPMENT
## THIS PROJECT IS UNDER RAPID DEVELOPMENT, AND NOT YET STABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE.

# RESALT

Resalt is a free, open-source, self-hosted, web-based SaltStack administration and monitoring panel.

> *Resalt is a word play from "Result" and "Salt".*

## 🔧 Set-up

Easiest is to use the Docker container image [UNDER CONSTRUCTION].

## 💖 Contributing

Setup development system:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Both the frontend (Svelte) and backend (Rust) will reload automatically.
